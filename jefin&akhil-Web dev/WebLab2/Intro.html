    <h1>Introduction to Web</h1>
    <p>A global computer network providing a variety of information and
        communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized
        communication protocols. "the guide is also available on the Internet"
        The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the
        Internetprotocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that
        consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global
        scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The
        Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services.</p>
        <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where
            documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
            interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist
            TimBerners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser
            computerprogram in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. The Web browser was
            released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to
            the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
            The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is
            the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet. Web pages are primarily text
            documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to
            formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are
            rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.
            Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages
            with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content
            can largely be provided by the publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the
            content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily
            for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organizational
            purposes
