    <h1>Client-Server</h1>
    <p>The client-server architecture refers to a system that hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services that the client requests. In this model, all requests and services are delivered over a network, and it is also referred to as the networking computing model or client server network.

        Client-server architecture, alternatively called a client-server model, is a network application that breaks down tasks and workloads between clients and servers that reside on the same system or are linked by a computer network.
        
        Client-server architecture typically features multiple usersâ€™ workstations, PCs, or other devices, connected to a central server via an Internet connection or other network. The client sends a request for data, and the server accepts and accommodates the request, sending the data packets back to the user who needs them.
        
        This model is also called a client-server network or a network computing model.
        
        To sum it up briefly:
        
        First, the client sends their request via a network-enabled device
        Then, the network server accepts and processes the user request
        Finally, the server delivers the reply to the client</p>
